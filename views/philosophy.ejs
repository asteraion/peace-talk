                        <p>Nonviolent Communication (NVC) teaches us to look behind behaviors to find the beautiful human <strong>Needs</strong> motivating them. It moves us from judgment ("You are wrong") to connection ("I feel hurt because I need safety").</p>

                        <p>A Course in Miracles (ACIM) teaches that all anger is a call for love. It invites us to practice <strong>Forgiveness</strong>—not as condoning bad behavior, but as releasing the illusion that we can be attacked.</p>

                <h2>The Synthesis</h2>
                <p class="lead-text">
                    NVC provides the <em>form</em>. ACIM provides the <em>content</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we use NVC, we often struggle to "guess" the other person's needs because we are still secretly angry. This is where ACIM enters. ACIM heals the mind so that NVC becomes natural rather than a technique.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Observation without Evaluation</strong> is the ACIM practice of seeing the world without projecting our past fears onto it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Taking Responsibility for Feelings</strong> aligns with the ACIM truth: "I am responsible for what I see. I choose the feelings I experience."

                    <li>
                        <strong>Requests, not Demands</strong> reflect the freedom of Love, which never imprisons.
